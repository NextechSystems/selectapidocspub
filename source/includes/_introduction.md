# Introduction

The Nextech Select APIs provide secure access to patient data through a RESTful implementation based on the STU 3 (3.0.1) version of the [FHIRÂ® standard](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/index.html). All API requests are performed over HTTPS and are protected by the [OAuth 2.0 standard](https://oauth.net/2/).

Available API functionality:  

* [Patient demographics](#patient-2)  
* [Patient clinical information](#allergy-intolerance)  
* [Patient payment posting](#payment-reconciliation)
* [Appointment information](#appointment)  
* [Confirm appointments](#appointment-2)  
* [Create non-clinical patient notes](#composition)
* [Attach patient documents](#document-reference)
