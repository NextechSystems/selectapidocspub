Searches for all slots matching the given search criteria. See [https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html) for instructions on formatting search criteria.  Only free slots are currently returned from the search.  A slot is returned for each practitioner/location combination.

#### HTTP Request 
`GET /Slot?{parameters}`

#### Parameters

| schedule.actor | query | The practitioners and/or locations of the slot you are searching for. At least one location actor is required.  If no practitioner actor is specified, all practitioners for the location specified will be searched.  A practitioner in practice is a schedule resource that is linked to a provider that is linked to a user in Nextech. | Yes | _<fill>_ |
|appointment-type | query | The appointment type the slot will be for.  | No if slot-length is specified | _<fill>_ |
|appointment-purpose | query | The appointment purpose the slot will be for.  | No | _<fill>_ |

#### Multiple Search Values
Multiple search values are supported for all fields except date.  To use multiple values, a comma should be placed in between the values you would like to search for.  This search results in the values being ORed together.  

If 2 practitioner schedule.actors are ORed together with a comma, any of those practitioners will be searched.  If they are ANDed together, all of the practitioners will be searched for, with a slot returned for each.   If you have both and AND and OR for practitioner scheduler.actors, they will all be ORed together.
