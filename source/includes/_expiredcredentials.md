***Rewrite this to use the specific error***
The credentials you use to access the API should not expire, but we have had some reports of this happening.

### Resetting Expired Credentials ###
If your credentials expire you will have to reset them by:

1. Going to Azure Active Directory by [clicking here] (http://portal.azure.com/).
2. Enter your expired credentials.
3. Follow the prompts it gives you.
4. Your password is now reset.
