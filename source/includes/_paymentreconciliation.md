A new transaction that is the exact opposite of the original is created with a current input date/effective date and also has a status of ‘Cancelled’. The net of these transactions are $0. <br> • When a transaction is Voided & Corrected in Nextech, the original transaction remains unchanged in the the original accounting period, but has a status of ‘Cancelled’.
