# Introduction

The Nextech Select APIs provide secure access to patient data through a RESTful implementation based on the R4 (4.0.1) version of the [FHIRÂ® standard](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html), and are protected by the [OAuth 2.0 standard](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749). All API requests are performed over HTTPS, and **must** use TLS 1.2.

Available API functionality:  

* [Metadata](#metadata)
* [Patient demographics](#patient-2)  
* [Patient clinical information](#allergy-intolerance)  
* [Attach patient documents](#create)
