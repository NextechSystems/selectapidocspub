# Introduction

The Nextech Select APIs provide secure access to patient data through a RESTful implementation based on the R4 (4.0.1) version of the [FHIR® standard](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/index.html). All API requests are performed over HTTPS and are protected by the [OAuth 2.0 standard](https://oauth.net/2/).

Available API functionality:  

* [Patient demographics](#patient-2)  
* [Patient clinical information](#allergy-intolerance)  
* [Create patient](#patient-2)  
* [Update patient](#patient-2)  
* [Attach patient documents](#document-reference)

Otherwise, if you've been provided with credentials to authenticate, then continue to the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section for more information.
