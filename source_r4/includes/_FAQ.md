# Frequently Asked Questions #


### Resetting Expired Credentials ###
If your credentials expire you will have to reset them by:

1. Going to Azure Active Directory by [clicking here] (http://portal.azure.com/).
2. Enter your expired credentials.
3. Follow the prompts it gives you.
4. Your password is now reset.

### Missing Practitioners ###
If the practitioners endpoint is not showing all of the expected practitioners check this before opening a support case.

1. Inside the Nextech application go to the Contacts module, select the provider that is not showing up.
2. Confirm that the practitioner is not marked Inactive on the checkbox on the right hand side.
3. Find the "Linked User" section and confirm that it is mapped to a unique account that is just for that practitioner.

Practitoners need their own user account to work with the practitoners endpoint.
